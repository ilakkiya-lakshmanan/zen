                <p class="text-justify">Companies like BYD have made good use of government policies that encouraged the
                    use of EVs. BYD cut its
                    teeth making batteries for mobile phones and portable electronic devices over the past two decades,
                    and
                    then scaled that technology to make batteries for electric buses and other automobiles, Shih noted.
                    “They have gotten a lot of practice over the last decade.Over time, China’s EV industry has more
                    than
                    enough room to grow. Even as it is the world’s biggest market for EVs, sales of those vehicles
                    account
                    for just about 4% of total vehicle sales, MacDuffie noted. Some studies projected EVs to command a
                    market share of 50% by 2025.

                    House",while Republican

                    of
                    presidential power, saying such a move could even be illegal.The Republican president denied all the
                    accusations.Earlier that day, the president told Fox
                    News: "I will probably do mine [acceptance speech] live from the White House. If for some reason
                    somebody had difficulty with it, I could go with someplace else.
