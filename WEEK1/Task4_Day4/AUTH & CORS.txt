Authorization:
The Authorization HTTP header provides authentication information on a request. There are several types of authentication that use this header, and some are supported by browsers, such as basic authentication. When an unauthenticated request is received by the server, it will respond with a HTTP 401 Unauthorized response with a WWW-Authenticate header. This will trigger the browser to ask the user for credentials. The browser will then perform the same request, but include an Authorization header with the entered credentials.

In contrast, some applications use the Authorization header without any intervening from the browser. A JavaScript app may obtain a token from the server and send that with each request to authenticate the request. This if called bearer authentication and the Authorization header is often used to send the token.

If you want to send an Authorization header along with a request to another site, that site has to notify the browser that that is permitted. After all, sites can\rquote t just access each other\rquote s pages. It would be insecure if this site could perform an AJAX request to your bank\rquote s site, using the cookies from your browser. However, there are some use cases for cross-site access. In that case, the CORS HTTP response headers can grant access to another site. These are response headers, so the application that handles the request has to give its OK that the response is used by another application.\par
